Hello! We are a team of 5 women working on a project for Women-in-Tech Hackathon Track 1. 

This project focuses on using haptics for ease of communication for people with disabilities. We hope that this brings more convenience to them.

Devices:
1. 1 working Laptop
2. 1 Android Phone
3. 1 Cable to connect said laptop and phone to transfer files

Instructions on setting up:
1. Install Android Studio. Please find the installer compatible to your device here: https://developer.android.com/studio/install 
2. On the Android Phone, change to Developer Mode (Go to Settings -> About device -> Version -> Tap 7 times on the Version Name).
3. On the Android Phone, go to Developer Options and turn on USB debugging (Make sure to authorise anything similar to this).
4. Ensure that the Android Phone and the Laptop are connected to the same WIFI, preferably a private network (e.g., hotspot).
5. Disable any firewalls for Python on the Laptop. (This may be preventing the code from running.)
6. Download and open the file "server.py" on any IDE, such as Visual Studio Code.
7. Download and open the folder "WIT version 1" on Android Studio.
8. Open the folder "App" under "WIT version 1" in a new window.
9. Use the Cable to connect the laptop and phone.
10. Allow changes to be made and drag down the notifications that pop up, tap on it to set up and select "Transfer files".
11. Run the code for "server.py" and copy the second address to the "MainActivity" file under the "App" window.
12. Open the first address in your browser. A dashboard will pop up.
